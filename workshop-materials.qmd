## Workshop format

*   Each workshop is 2 hours long
*   You choose which topic to work on. It is advised to work through the materials in the prescribed order unless you are already familiar with a particular topic
*   You will work with fellow learners, utilising your prior experience and web searches to find solutions, with a R expert on hand if you get stuck
*   Workshop sessions are hands on and practical 
*   Each worksheet will take on average 1 hour to complete (some longer, some shorter)

To prepare for the in-person workshops you need to get the materials. Below is information and steps on how to do this, as well as information on what is covered and recommended pathways.

## Workshop pathways

The files for the workshops are broken into four different series: Fundamentals, Intermediate, Data Wrangling, and Data Visualisation. There are several pathways through the workshops depending on your needs and preferences which are shown in the flow diagrams below.

![Flow diagram showing the pathway for those that are primarily interested in using R for data analysis and visualisation, with an option to do the intermediate series](images/data_R_series.png){width=60%}

These flow diagrams were all made with R using the package `DiagrammeR`. The code that made them can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/andrewmoles2/graphviz-figures/blob/main/r_workshops.R). 

## Workshop materials

Download the R Markdown files from each series below. Just press the button and the respective materials will download. Save the files where you can later find them.

## Uncompressing files (important)

Once downloaded it is important that you ***unzip/uncompress*** the file. The download is a zip file, which a file that has been compressed to save space for easier transfer and storage. You should uncompress these files otherwise it can be hard for some software to use the files inside. 

**Windows**

Right-click on the file and choose *Extract All*, then select a location to save the uncompressed file. 

**Mac**

Double click on the file and the uncompressed contents will appear next to your compressed file.
