## Opening RStudio

If you have not done so already, open RStudio!

### Windows users

-   Type `RStudio` in the search bar (bottom left, next to windows symbol)
-   If you prefer, open the start menu (click windows symbol), then scroll until you find RStudio

### Mac users

-   Hit command + space and type in `RStudio`
-   If you prefer to look for RStudio in an applications folder (open finder and select Applications on the left panel), you should be looking for this icon: ![](images/rs.png)

When RStudio opens you should see a layout with 3 panels, similar to the image below.

![RStudio, image from 2023](images/rstudio.png)

The largest panel on the left with the `>` is the console. On the bottom right there is the files/plot panel, and top right is the environment panel.

If your installation of R and RStudio has worked, first RStudio should be open, and second you should see a message in your console panel telling you the version of R you have installed, like the image below.

There are three ways of running R code: console, scripts and R Markdown. In the R workshops we use R Markdown. 

## R Scripts

### What are R Scripts?

An R Script file is a text file that contains a set of commands, or code, written in the R programming language. They are simple to use, allowing you to save the code you have written for later.  

An in-depth description can be found in the [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/workflow-scripts.html) open source book

### Opening R Scripts

If you move your mouse/curser to the top of your screen you will see a banner with *file*, *edit*, *code* etc. Using `File > Open File...`, find the R script file to load. R script files have the extension `.R`.

To start a new R script file go to `File > New File > R Script`, or use the keyboard shortcut `ctrl/command + shift + N`.

### Using R Scripts

The below image shows an R Script in action. 

![Image of R Script](images/R-script.png){width="90%" fig-align="center"}

There are two main ways of running code in an R Script. 

*   Use `ctrl/command + Enter` to run each line
*   Highlight a section of code, and use the run button (or press `ctrl/command + Enter`)

You might notice code you have run appears on the console (bottom left), and if you make a variable that will appear in the Environment (top right). 

## R Markdown

### What is R Markdown?

An R Markdown file has sections of text and code together in a single document. This is helpful for tutorials, documentation, and writing reports.

An in-depth description can be found in the [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/r-markdown.html) open source book

### Opening R Markdown files

Opening a R Markdown file is very similar to opening a file in other software. If you move your mouse/curser to the top of your screen you will see a banner with *file*, *edit*, *code* etc. Using `File > Open File...`, find the R Markdown file to load. R Markdown files have the extension `.Rmd`.

To start a new R markdown file go to `File > New File > R Markdown...`.

### Using a R Markdown file

We are using R Markdown notebooks for these workshops as we can add text around code, which can help us guide you. The image below shows the basic layout of a R Markdown document.

There are three ways to run code in a code cell. The two ways mentioned in the image (Run and play button), and third is to use `ctrl/command + Enter` to run each line just like you would with an R script.

The most important thing for you to take note of is the code cells. Each code cell is like a small R script. You'll notice the \`\`\` markings around the code cell. It is important these do not get deleted, so be careful when editing your code!

Finally, you can add your own code cell using `option+command+i` on a Mac or `ctrl + alt + i` on a Windows machine.

Throughout the notebooks you will come across exercises, with empty code cells for you to type your code into. Your task is to test out the examples, then try and do the exercises.
